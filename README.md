<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>

<p align="center">
  My name is <strong>Cr0mb</strong>, and I am a young male living in North America. I have been passionate about computer science and programming from a young age. I've dedicated a lot of time to explore various computer languages and systems, as well as exploring different aspects of technology. Fun fact: I installed my first malware at the age of 6!

<p align="center">
  Watching Robert Crumb's documentary inspired me to publish my coding works and continue developing independently. His dedication to authenticity and craftsmanship motivated me to learn and create rather than taking shortcuts with others' work.
</p>

<p align="center">
  To this day, I honor his work and use this image he created to symbolize my commitment to authenticity and independent creation in coding and development.

  Robert Crumb's countercultural persona and provocative art often challenge norms and authority. For example, his comic "Keep on Truckin'" has a psychedelic style portraying characters defying societal conventions and rebellious attitude towards mainstream culture at the time.

<h2 align="center">My Favorite Projects (so far)</h2>

<p align="center">
  <strong>Project 1:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Cr0mb/mcWizard">mcWizard</a><br>
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54"><br>
  Python-based toolset for conducting advanced reconnaissance tasks on web resources associated with IP addresses. It leverages asyncio for concurrent scanning, aiohttp for asynchronous HTTP requests, and integrates various utilities for handling files, terminal interactions, and network-related tasks.

  Cryptonix is a Python tool for generating Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses along with their corresponding private keys. It scans for balances on these addresses and displays the results. If a balance is found, it saves the successful combinations to a file named btcWin.txt.
