## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Welcome to My Portfolio!

## About Me
My name is Cr0mb, and I am a young male living in North America. I have been passionate about computer science and programming from a young age. I've dedicated a lot of time to learning various computer languages and exploring different aspects of technology. Fun fact: I installed my first malware at the age of 6!

## My Favorite Projects (so far)
### Project 1: [mcWizard](https://github.com/Cr0mb/mcWizard)
Python-based toolset for conducting advanced reconnaissance tasks on web resources associated with IP addresses. It leverages asyncio for concurrent scanning, aiohttp for asynchronous HTTP requests, and integrates various utilities for handling files, terminal interactions, and network-related tasks.

### Project 2: [Cryptonix BTC/ETH Scanner](https://github.com/Cr0mb/Cryptonix-BTC-ETH-Scanner)
Cryptonix is a Python tool for generating Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses along with their corresponding private keys. It scans for balances on these addresses and displays the results. If a balance is found, it saves the successful combinations to a file named btcWin.txt.

### Project 3: [Python Web Scanner](https://github.com/Cr0mb/Python-Web-Scanner)
Python-based toolset for conducting advanced reconnaissance tasks on web resources associated with IP addresses. It leverages asyncio for concurrent scanning, aiohttp for asynchronous HTTP requests, and integrates various utilities for handling files, terminal interactions, and network-related tasks.
