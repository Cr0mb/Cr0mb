## üêç Why Python for Game Hacking?

- **Unique approach:** Python is less common in game hacking ‚Äî great for innovation.
- **Rapid prototyping:** Minimal syntax, faster development.
- **Powerful libs:** `ctypes`, `pymem`, Cheat Engine Python integration.
- **Versatile:** Networking, automation, GUIs, and more.
- Inspired by Guided Hacking but built mostly from self-learning.
